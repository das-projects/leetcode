# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/
# Difficulty: Hard
# Question: You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it. 
# Example 1:
# Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
# Explanation: The linked-lists are: 
# [
#   1->4->5,
#   1->3->4,
#   2->6
# ]
# merging them into one sorted list:
# 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
# Example 2:
# Input: lists = []
# Output: []
# Example 3:
# Input: lists = [[]]
# Output: []
# Constraints:
# k == lists.length
# 0 <= k <= 10^4
# 0 <= lists[i].length <= 500
# -10^4 <= lists[i][j] <= 10^4
# lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.  

# Definition for singly-linked list.
