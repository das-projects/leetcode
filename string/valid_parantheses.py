# 20. Valid Parentheses
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/
# Difficulty: Easy
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# An input string is valid if:
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "()"
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true
# Example 3:
# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false
# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str

        d = {'(':')', '{':'}','[':']'}
        stack = []
        for i in s:
            if i in d:  # 1
                stack.append(i)
            elif len(stack) == 0 or d[stack.pop()] != i:  # 2
                return False
        return len(stack) == 0 # 3
	
# 1. if it's the left bracket then we append it to the stack
# 2. else if it's the right bracket and the stack is empty(meaning no matching left bracket), or the left bracket doesn't match
# 3. finally check if the stack still contains unmatched left bracket
